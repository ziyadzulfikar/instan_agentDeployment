# Instana deployment options

Last Updated: 2024-06-28

Instana can be deployed either as a SaaS solution with the option of retaining data in the cloud, or as a self-hosted (on-premises) solution. With Instana, you have control of where your data resides, on the cloud or on-premises. Thus, Instana combines the simplicity of SaaS with the control of an on-premises deployment.

##  Instana SaaS deployment

If you want to deploy Instana SaaS, you need to install only Instana agents.

**Note:** Before you install Instana agents, you need to review the system requirements and outbound network access requirements, and prepare endpoints and keys.

1.  Administer your Instana Tenant, such as onboarding users, managing API, agent keys, and role-based access control (RBAC), configuring user interface settings, and viewing audit logs. For more information, see [Administer Instana](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/admin/index.html).

##  Instana self-hosted deployment

If you want to deploy Instana in your on-premises environment, you need to install both the Instana backend (Instana server) and Instana agents.

**Note:** Before you install Instana, you need to review the system requirements and outbound network access requirements, and prepare endpoints and keys.

##  Instana agent deployment

*   [Host agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/setup_and_manage/host_agent/index.html): A host agent runs on your host to collect and aggregate data from various sensors before it sends the data to the Instana backend. You can install the host agent on a virtual machine (VM), a physical host, Kubernetes, Cloud Foundry, VMware® Tanzu, or other similar platforms.
*   After you install the host agent, most Instana agent sensors, which are designed to monitor specific technologies, are automatically installed. Some sensors are also automatically configured after the host agent is installed. But for the other sensors, you need to do some configurations to make these sensors work. For the list of supported sensors, see [Agent sensors](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/ecosystem/index.html#agent-sensors).
*   [Cloud service agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/setup_and_manage/cloud_service_agents/index.html): These agents monitor services that are managed by cloud providers, like Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) or Azure subscriptions.
*     
    
*   [Serverless agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/setup_and_manage/serverless/index.html): These agents monitor AWS Lambda and other Serverless platforms.
*     
    
*   [Website agent and mobile agents](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/SSE1JP5_current/src/pages/setup_and_manage/web_and_mobile_app_agents/index.html): These agents monitor websites and mobile applications.
